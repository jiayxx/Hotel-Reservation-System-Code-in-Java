# Hotel-Reservation-System-Code-in-Java
A hotel reservation system is a software application that allows guests to book directly with the hotel online, with no intermediaries necessary. The software essentially processes online reservations made via the hotel’s website and then passes this information to the hotel’s own backend so that the information can be easily accessed.
